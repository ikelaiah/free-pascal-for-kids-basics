## üõ†Ô∏è Compiler Directives

In some of the programs, you will see the following line at the top of the code:

```pascal
{$mode objfpc}{$H+}{$J-}
```

This line enables specific compiler modes and settings:

- `{$mode objfpc}`: Enables Object Pascal mode, which supports modern Pascal features.
- `{$H+}`: Enables the use of long strings (dynamic strings) instead of short strings.
- `{$J-}`: Disables the ability to modify typed constants, ensuring safer code.

These directives ensure compatibility and better functionality for the programs in this course.
