## üíª Requirements

- [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) (fpc) installed on your machine
- A text editor like Notepad++ or VSCode
- Basic typing skills and curiosity!

---

## üìÇ How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikelaiah/free-pascal-for-kids-basics.git
cd freepascal-for-kids/week01_hello_world
fpc hello_world.pas
./hello_world   # or hello_world.exe on Windows
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Compiler Directives

In some of the programs, you will see the following line at the top of the code:

```pascal
{$mode objfpc}{$H+}{$J-}
```

This line enables specific compiler modes and settings:

- `{$mode objfpc}`: Enables Object Pascal mode, which supports modern Pascal features.
- `{$H+}`: Enables the use of long strings (dynamic strings) instead of short strings.
- `{$J-}`: Disables the ability to modify typed constants, ensuring safer code.

These directives ensure compatibility and better functionality for the programs in this course.
